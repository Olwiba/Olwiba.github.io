				<h2>What a responsive site is, and why responsiveness is important?</h2>
        <p>A responsive website is a site that changes the way that it displays in the browser depending on the device. As there are many different devices that people use to browse the Internet, creating a responsive website is vital to ensuring a good user experience. 
        This is done by using scalable dimensions, for example you could say <a>#header { width:100%; }</a> this will ensure that the header id will span <a>100%</a> of the page width. If I had used <a>#header { width: 960px; }</a> then the header element would be locked to <a>960px</a> for any device. When viewing on a computer monitor this might look alright and you might not run in to any issues there although as soon as you try to open your site on a laptop or mobile device then this is going to go off the screen and you will not be able to see it. 
        As a developer there are many tools that can be used to help make your site responsive such as creating a site using a framework, this is just a predetermined set of rules for you to design your site with. By using a framework properly you will ensure that everything is going to fit on you page, most frameworks have mobile queries implemented into them as well removing many issues that you might come across with the layout on smaller devices. </p>
        <h2>What mobile first design is, and why it's important?</h2>
        <p>Mobile first design is when you create the mobile layout before anything else, hence mobile "first". Creating the mobile design first
        helps the developer make difficult decisions about the content. Mobile design is often created using a liner layout, using this approach it forces
        you into a content hierarchy. You will have the most important content at the top followed by the second, so on and so forth. 
        Using mobile first design it will ensure that all the content will fit on mobile devices, from there you can create your desktop design easily.</p>
        <h2>What frameworks are, and their pros and cons</h2>
        <p>Frameworks are great, they provide developers with the backbone for creating responsive websites. Frameworks have predefined layout styles that have been created using scalable dimensions to ensure that the content that has been placed inside of it will fit on the page. 

        Every framework will have its pro and cons but I'm going to list a few i found for the skeleton framework.

        Pros:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>- Easy to use</li>
          <li>- Many different classes to choose from</li>
          <li>- Features many different elements including buttons, lists, forms etc.</li>
          <li>- Lightweight with ~400 lines of code</li>
          <li>- Built with mobile in mind</li>
          <li>- Zero compiling</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Cons:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>- Default max width is 960px so doesn't span whole page</li>
          <li>- Predefined text styles</li>
          <li>- Find it hard to implement already created code</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>What a wireframe is and why we use it?</h2>
        <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website_wireframe">Wiki</a> explains it well with their wireframe article, "A website wireframe, also known as a page schematic or screen blueprint, 
          is a visual guide that represents the skeletal framework of a website. Wireframes are created for the purpose of arranging 
          elements to best accomplish a particular purpose. The purpose is usually being informed by a business objective and a creative idea.
           The wireframe depicts the page layout or arrangement of the websites content, including interface elements and navigational systems,
           and how they work together."</p>
        <h2>The aspects of your wireframes you found difficult to implement, and why?</h2>
        <p>I had some problems trying to get my hexagon navigation to be responsive, I got them on the page and changing size depending on the screen size although 
        I am having troubles trying to get them to drop down into a linier format when on mobile, this will be a work in progress and I hope to get this working by the end of next week. 
        I Also found it hard to get my header and footer to span the whole page, this was because the framework had set the max screen size to 960px. So when using a width:
        100% on a child of container (where the framework wanted me to put my page content)  it wasn't working. To fix this I needed to pull the header and footer out of the container
        and give it custom styling. </p>
