        <h2>Growing Trust</h2>
        <p>
          From the chapter I learnt that growing trust is an essential foundation for building a long-term relationship with someone.<br/>
          If we treat people with <a>Kindness</a> and <a>Empathy</a> we can establish greater trust and understanding. 
          Chade-Meng offers advice from Dr. Karen May on how we can build trust between two people.<br/>
          Firstly she suggests to practice giving people the benefit of the doubt; The reason why is because when someone makes a decision is usually because its what they believe is right, based on the information and what they are trying to accomplish. Even if you don't agree or would choose otherwise, Assume that they are making the right decision and continue. <br/><br/>
          Secondly she suggests that trust "begets" or causes trust; This is true because if i believe that someone is a trustworthy person and I treat them in such a way then the other person is much more likely to trust me back. This also works the other way as if someone believes that I'm a trustworthy person and treats me in such a way then I'm much more likely to trust them back. 
        </p>
        <h2>Loving Kindness Meditation</h2>
        <p>
          After calming my mind for the initial 2 minutes I was directed to focus on a person in my life that I care about. I thought about this person, keeping the thought in the front of my mind. I then read through the "Just like me" statements, this made me feel that the person I was thinking about has been through the ups and downs of life just like me. I then read through the "I wish statements" which made me want to help this person I was thinking about to achieve greater happiness. After feeling this sensation of wanting to help someone i know, I then pondered on the statement of "I wish everyone I know to be happy". I thought about having this sensation for everyone I know, it felt nice to want everyone one to be happy but I could only accept this statement with condition.
        </p>
        <h2>Political Awareness</h2>
        <p>
          A conflict scenario that i was in was when something of mine went missing from my bedroom, This obviously through up many questions and concerns about my flatmates at the time and I was determined to get to the bottom of it.<br/>
          If i was 100% right, I believed that it could have only been one person: Person X, I spoke with person X many times about what had gone missing and how I wanted it replaced. Due to the time frame and who was around when my property went missing I could only track it back to one person. I was adamant that it was this person and still to this day believe so.<br/>
          If they were 100% right, They were around when it went missing but they had nothing to do with it. Supposedly chilling in their room while someone came into the house and took it. Person X didn't have any explanation to whom it could have been just that they needed to defend their innocence as it cant of been them.<br/><br/>
          
          Seeing the story from both sides help me try and understand what both parties were feeling although with an underlying feeling of mistrust It's hard to believe that the other persons story could have been 100% right
