    <h1>My Reflections on starting at EDA</h1>
    <h3>17/03/2016</h3>
    <h2>What's your take on the EDA experience?</h2>

    <p>
      The EDA experience is nothing like any study I have done before. From the learning environment through to the vast variety of students doing the course with me, the whole learning process is going to be both challenging but at the same time rewarding. I feel even though there is a lot for me to take out of this experience there will also be plenty for me to put back in, from helping others to helping shape the future for myself and the EDA.
    </p>
    <h2>What are your impressions?</h2>

    <p>
      My first impression was that the EDA offer a very unique way of doing things, this was apparent as soon as I stepped foot in to their facilities. It isn’t like most education, it's really an experience something for myself as well as all the people within my cohort to take apart in, engage and share ideas to better myself and everyone in my cohorts understanding of web development.
    </p>
    <h2>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</h2>

    <p>
      The only way I can get the best education I can from this programme is for me step outside of my comfort zone engage with the EDA community, ask questions when I get stuck and help others when possible. I need to be honest with myself about how confident I feel and if not take some extra time to go back over the parts I find difficult.
    </p>
    <h2>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</h2>

    <p>
      After watching the Fireside chat video it has only enforced the type of learning environment and structure that I initially thought EDA as being. I feel that it's not what the EDA is expecting from me but more what I’m expecting from myself, I need to continuously be challenging myself and reaching for the absolute best of my ability.
    </p>
    <h2>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</h2>

    <p>
      I think when starting something new there's always a feeling of nervousness in the air, although like most things after the first few days everything settles down and people start to come out of their shell. As this learning environment is nothing like I have ever done before I’m really excited to participate and dive right in to it.
