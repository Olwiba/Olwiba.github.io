				<h1>Daily Mindfulness</h1>
        <h2>What did you learn from your 'mindfulness conversation'? How did the other person find it?</h2>
        <p>
        Today I tried something new for the first time, this was a technique called <a>Mindful Listening</a> , It is the process of talking to a partner for 3 minutes without interuption. My partner was only alowed to speak to acknowlage what I was saying otherwise they needed to stay quiet. After my 3 minutes were done it was then my partners turn to speak uninterupted for 3 minutes. </p><br>
        <p>
          The outcome of this exercise was very intereting, sure there were portions of the conversation where it went quiet until the speaker thought of soemthing else to say but this also gave the listener time to absorb everything that they have been listeneing to. I found that by using this technique both of us managed to say everything that we wanted to say without interuption and it was a very relaxing experiance. 
        </p><br>
        <p>
          Both me any my partner came out of it thinking "We should definiatly try this more often!" , There has been times when working on projects or explaining ideas to people that can be hard to get accross. By using this technieque I feel it would be a much more effective way to explain things to people and then hear there response.
        </p>
        <h2>Which of the three suggested techniques will you use to sustain your practice?</h2>
        <p>
          The technique that I have adopted to sustain my practice is I found a mindfulness buddy. I talked to my flatmate who also lives a very busy life and showed him the benefits that come from meditation, now everyday we encorage eachother to take a break and do some mindfulness practice. 
 
          Having someone there to help remind you each day really helps and often it is nice to do it together.
