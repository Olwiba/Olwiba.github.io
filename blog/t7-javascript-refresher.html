				<h1>JavaScript Refresher</h1>
				<h2>Data-Types</h2>
        <h3>Different types of Data-Types</h3>
        <p>Here are the 5 different data-types of Javascript:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Numbers</li>
          <li>Strings</li>
          <li>Booleans</li>
          <li>Objects</li>
          <li>Arrays</li>
        </ul>
        <p>A <a>Number</a> is a data-type that holds well, You guessed it Numbers! When declaring a number you dont use quotes simply assign a variable to a numeric value. <a>Numbers</a> can be used with arithmetic operators to preform various calculations.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Example:</li>
          <li>var num = 10;</li>
        </ul>
        <p>A <a>String</a> is a data-type that is primarily used to hold words/sentences. When you declare a string you must put quotes around the data that you are placing inside of the variable. Stings can hold pretty much any character such as letters A - Z, Numbers and even symbols however stings don't work like numbers do. Anything that is placed inside a sting is considered to the interpreter as a word and standard arithmetic operators don't work the same way as numbers do. <a>Stings</a> can be manipulated in many ways to achieve the desired result such as concatenation, slicing, replacing and many more.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Example:</li>
          <li>var string = "This is my string";</li>
        </ul>
        <p><a>Booleans</a> are a special type of data-type. These only ever have one of two values <a>true</a> or <a>false</a>. I like to think of theses like a light switch, it's either on or off and cant be anything else. This data-type is useful when working with javascript as we can create conditional statements to preform code execution.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Example:</li>
          <li>A good example of a boolean is when i created my game.. I had a playerWon boolean that was set to false at the start of the game and enabled things such as controllers and game play functions. After the game had been won this was set to true and the controls and game play functions stopped execution.</li>
          <li>var playerWon = false;</li>
        </ul>
        <p>An <a>Object</a> data-type is basically a variable holding variables. Pretty much all the data-types in javascript are objects but have been designed to serve a purpose. To declare an <a>Object</a> in Javascript you must put the data inside of curly braces, you can declare both the property title for the specific data and also what is inside it. It's easiest to show you with an example.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Example:</li>
          <li>var myObject = {</li>
          <li>property1: "Data 1",</li>
          <li>property2: "Data 2",</li>
          <li>propertyNumber: 32</li>
          <li>};</li>
        </ul>
        <p>An <a>Array</a> data-type holds multiple values in a single variable. These can be strings, numbers even booleans if you wanted. To declare an <a>Array</a> you use brackets. Inside these brackets you then place all the information you need, you can even leave it blank if you wish to simply just cache a empty array. You can manipulate the array by removing, replacing and adding to the array.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Here i created a simple array:</li>
          <li>var myArray = ["data1", "data2", "data3"];</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Say you wanted to access the nth data inside the array you can access it by calling the array and using brackets again placing the data location inside of them.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>I want to find out what the third item is inside of myArray. Remember that the index starts at 0 so it would be 3 (target) - 1 = 2</li>
          <li>myArray[2];</li>
          <li>This would spit out "data3"</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Using the access technique I just talked about you can the preform manipulation on the data, Other methods such as finding specific data in an array and replacing it or even "popping" and "pushing" can be done but I'll save that for another day. </p>
        <h3>Gaps Filled</h3>
        <p>I found out how to pass a function into another function, This was something that I hadn't done before and found it to be very useful as you can make functions more universal instead of having to rewrite them if you needed them to preform the same thing but for different variables.</p>
        <h3>Unsure?</h3>
        <p>After completing the chapters in eloquent Javascript I feel there is still much to grasp before i can call myself a Javascript wizard but each week I am trying hard to learn more and more. Going back over chapters that we have already covered I can see how things that I used to find difficult are now making much more sense.</p>
