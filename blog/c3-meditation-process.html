				<h1>Meditation Techniques</h1>
        <h2>How did the 'process over product' concept affect the way you tackled the site redesign and rebuild?</h2>
        <p>I found the process over product concept hard as I am a bit of a perfectionist, although after giving it a go it really helped me to get the basics out of the way so that I can then move on with the other stuff. I feel that this is something that I will need to work on as I constantly found myself trying to style things when I should have saved them until last. </p>
				<h2>What did you think about mediation before watching chapter 2?</h2>
				<p>Before watching chapter 2 I looked at meditation as a time to relax the body and mind and relieve yourself from stress, I thought there was a specific technique to the way to meditate such as body position and keeping my eyes closed.</p>
				<h2>What new things have you learnt about mediation?</h2>
				<p>I have learnt that the traditional way of meditation is something that most people in todays world find hard to perfect, finding what position best suits you can be anything that can keep you alert but also relaxed.  I also learnt how to deal with distractions when meditating, this is done by keeping focused on breathing. As soon as you see yourself becoming distracted
				take a deep breath and focus on the sensation that breathing gives you. 
				When your meditating with your eyes closed you often start to feel sleepy, this can be counteracted by opening your eyes again. However this can lead to distractions, the best way that
				i learn to deal with this problem is to sit with your eyes half open letting minimal light though and looking at the ground. 
				I liked the analogy that they used about learning to ride a bike, when your riding and you start to fall to the left your body will adjust to the right subconsciously same for if you where to fall the other way,
				your mind when meditating can be trained to do the same with distractions if every time you see yourself becoming distracted and you bring your focus back to your breathing after time you body will 
				do this automatically.</p>
