        <h2>What learnings did you take from the chapter?</h2>  
        <p>In this chapter of Search Inside Yourself we dove deeper in to the concept of mastering our emotions. They referred to our emotions as a horse, while untrained the horse will go  wherever it wants wants to go; with some training the rider can then direct the horse and control its direction. This is the same as mindfulness-training if you can train yourself to control your emotions you will then be able to steer them in the right direction.</p>
        <p>They say that it is almost impossible to stop an unwholesome thought or emotion from arising although it is possible to <a>let them go </a>. The analogy they used was like writing on water, as soon as it is written it has already disappeared. As soon as you feel a unwholesome thought or emotion present itself to you just like writing on water you must let it pass.</p>
        <p>Grasping is when the mind desperately holds on to something and refuses to let it go. Aversion is when the mind desperately keeps something away and refuses to let it come. These two qualities make up a major percentage of suffering the author suggests   perhaps 90 to 100%!  Letting go of these qualities can help reduce suffering or even stop suffering altogether.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The Siberian North Railroad technique consists of 5 main steps</li>
          <li><a>1. Stop</a></li>
          <li><a>2. Breathe</a></li>
          <li><a>3. Notice</a></li>
          <li><a>4. Reflect</a></li>
          <li><a>5. Respond</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>This technique is great way to deal with negative or distressing emotions when they are triggered. In my own personal experience It has proven to be extremely useful as I was sitting at work working though a boat load of invoices already pushed for time, then I was given another stack to work on. Instead of getting stressed out at the already minimal time I had to get them done then work on my Dev Academy work I took some time to go though the steps and control my emotions. This prevented me from saying anything apart from "Thank you" to my boss and also prevented me from getting worked up over the matter.  </p>
        <h2> How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness? </h2>
        <p>My two minutes of mindfulness today was very relaxing, it gives me a change to unwind and clear my mind. This gave me some time to deal with stressful emotions that where getting me down and let them go. I came out of it feeling much more happy with myself as well as gave me some clarity on what I need to be getting on with. </p>
