				<h1>Problem Solving</h1>
				<h2>Getting Blocked</h2>
        <p>This week when working on the Javascript racer game I found that I became blocked fairly quickly, I didn't really know where to begin, I found myself going back over the past weeks exercises to see what I had missed and what techniques could be best applied to my game. This is when I remembered some of the coding strategies that we had been taught like Pseudocoding and The rubber ducky method. 
       </p>
       <p>
        Using Pseudocode I was able to break down parts of my application into smaller sections, this enabled me to look at each problem separately and proved to make it easier for me to solve the problems one at a time. If i came accross something that i felt excessivly blockd on I would use the rubber ducky technique to work though my problem utilising the power of google and stack overflow. Granted not always this would work and my application still has a few bug that I'm working on fixing.
       </p>
       <h2>Solving Problems</h2>
       <p>
         My biggest challenge that I found when creating the game was getting the players to move along the track. I Managed to solve this problem by using the rubber ducky method and looking at examples from similar style games. This often helped give me ideas on how i could implement the same ideas into what I was trying to create. 

         Making proper use of the online resources that are available really helps with getting ideas and helping solve difficult problems, for every problem I Google I often find about five - ten answers which is really helpful.
       </p>
       <h2>JS Array Methods</h2>
       <p>
         <a>.map()</a>
       </p>
       <p>This function creates an array with the result of it calling a specified function for every element inside of the array. 
       </p>
       <br>
       <p>
       <a>.filter()</a>
       </p>
       <p>
         This function will create an array but only be populated by the elements in which the filtering function returns true.  
       </p>
       <br>
       <p>
         <a>.reduce()</a>
       </p>
       <p>
         The reduce function is an interesting one, it can reduce the elements of an array into a single value by applying a function against an accumulator and each value of the array .
