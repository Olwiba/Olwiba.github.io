        <h2>The Three P's</h2>  
        <p>Breaking happiness into the three P's helps evaluate the sustainability of this emotion.<br />
        The first P is Pleasure. This type of mind is one that gains happiness from doing impulsive things that are generally short lived such as buying sweets or playing video games. The happiness that you get from this mind doesn't last long and after the happiness fades you will begin 'chasing the next high' again. This P is unsustainable and wont lead to long lasting happiness.
        <br />
        The second P is Passion also known as 'Flow'. This type of mind is engaged and is preforming well in situations that are challenging but also not too difficult. The happiness that you get from this is ongoing as long as you are continuing to work and time will fly by however when you stop working the happiness you were getting from the challenge will slowly fade. 
        <br />
        The last P is Purpose. This mind focuses on the higher purpose, being part of something that is bigger then yourself and something that has meaning to you. The happiness that is gained from this is ongoing and can last forever yet is something that we don't often work on. 
        <br />
        At the moment i would say my mind is in the Passion mind-state with often dabbling in Pleasure although I haven't really spend much time to focus on Purpose. Realizing this now I want to try and focus on Purpose, often working with passion and reduce the amount of time spent in the Pleasure phase.

        <h2>Core Values</h2>
        <h3>Honesty</h3>
        <p>
        I strive to be honest with myself and others  in all aspects of life. Being honest to myself is extremely important as it enables me to see the bigger picture, understand where I'm at in life and how I'm feeling. Being honest to others is just as important as it helps the other person get a 'real' response to my opinion or how I feel about a certain situation.
        </p>
        <h3>Loyal</h3>
        <p>
          Loyalty is something that I strongly believe in, making a commitment to always be there for friends and family no matter the circumstances really helps differentiate between the 'real' people and the 'fake' ones.
        </p>
        <h3>Positive</h3>
        <p>
          I choose to see life from a "Glass half full" type of mind set. In every situation there are going to be positives and negatives and its your choice to which you want to focus on. Keeping positive is an essential part of being happy and productive. Sometimes I need to think about the negatives before i can see the positives so keeping an open mind is essential but nothing good will ever come from dwelling on the negatives.
        </p>
        <h3>Integrity</h3>
        <p>
          Setting high standards for myself and my work is often at times challenging and takes a huge amount of self-control and dedication. At times it can be hard to stick with the standards that I have set myself but the feeling of being proud of my work is something thats worth working hard for.
        </p>
        <h3>Respect</h3>
        <p>
          Having respect for others and oneself is really important, I believe that everyone, everywhere is entitled to respect.
        </p>
        <h3>Trustworthy</h3>
        <p>
          Being a trustworthy person is a major part of life and is essential to a healthy relationship with someone else.
        </p>
        <h2>Resilience & Meditation</h2>
        <p>
          I enjoyed this weeks meditation exercise as it let me experience how the thought of failure and success feels on the mind. I figured how to deal with these feelings letting them come and go as they please. The writing exercise on our future was a really good eye opener for me as I wrote down where I could be if i put my mind to it and to read back over what I wrote to myself I felt that it was defiantly possible.
