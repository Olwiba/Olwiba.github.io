				<h1>Self Confidence</h1>
        <h2>What is the relationship between mindfulness and self awareness?</h2>  
        <p>
         In chapter 4 we learn that mindfulness and self awareness are essentially the same thing! The traditional analogy of this mind is a fluttering flag on a flagpole, where the flag represents the mind. When experiencing strong emotions the mind may be turbulent causing the flag to flutter but with mindfulness this acts as a flagpole, this keeps the mind grounded. Stopping the flag from fluttering away.
        </p>
        <h2>Body Scan</h2>
        <p>
          When doing a body scan it was nice to take a moment to focus on sensations that I am experiencing throughout my body, from my head all the way down to my toes. Once I took some time to focus on specific areas of the body I noticed much more feeling or sensation was going on then I originally thought. After experiencing these sensations through-out the body I was instructed to think of a nice thought, A time or place in which I felt optimal and productive . I was able to experience what positive emotion felt like in the body and how if effected what sensations that were going on in the body. 
        </p>
        <h2> What did you take away from the "My Emotions are Not Me" section?</h2>
        <p>
            In this section we have a look at how our emotions are simply what we are feeling instead of who we are. With enough mindfulness practice you may notice a subtle but important shift, Emotions go from a being an existential (“I am”) to experiential (“I feel”) experience. The importance of this shift is that it enables the possibility of mastery over ones emotions!
