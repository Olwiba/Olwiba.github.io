				<h1>Scope</h1>
				<h2>What is Scope?</h2>
        <p>
          In programming the <a>scope</a> of a variable refers the section of code in which a variable exists. Within the section of code that the variable has been created it can be accessed and manipulated in whatever way the programmer designed the code to run. However once you step outside the boundary of this section the variable can no longer be referenced. <br />
          However there are ways to make variables available throughout the whole program, In Javascript there are two types of variables <a>Global</a> and <a>Local</a>.
        </p>
        <h2> Global Variables </h2>
        <p>
         <a>Global</a> variables are variables that are declared outside of a function, these have been written inside the main block of code and can be accessed and manipulated from anywhere within the program giving it a "Global Scope".<br />
        As you can see from the example below the <a>myGlobalVar</a> variable has been created outside the functions, this is now a <a>Global</a> variable and can be accessed and changed by any function within the program. 
        </p>
        <h3>Example:</h3>
        <p>
          var myGlobalVar = "This is my global variable!"; // As you can see I have declared my global variable <br/>

          function firstFunction() {  // Here is a function accessing and manipulating the myGlobalVar variable<br/>
            myGlobalVar = "Global variable accessed from inside first function!";<br/>
          }<br/>

          function secondFunction() { // Here is another function accessing and manipulating the myGlobalVar variable<br/>
            myGlobalVar = "Global variable accessed from inside second function!";<br/>
          }
        </p>
        <h2> Local Variables </h2>
        <p><a>Local</a> variables are variables that have been created within a function and have become "local" to that specific function. These variables have a "Local scope" as they can only be accessed and manipulated locally by the function that they have been created by.<br/>
        Using the same structure as the previous example we can see that <a>myLocalVar</a> has been created inside of my first function. This means that the variable can only be accessed within my <a>firstFunction</a>, when we try and access it from <a>secondFunction</a> we will get a reference error as my second function cannot see the <a>myLocalVar</a> variable.
        </p>
        <h3>Example: </h3>
        <p>
        function firstFunction() {  // Here is a function accessing and manipulating the myGlobalVar variable<br/>
          var myLocalVar = "This is my local variable!";<br/>
          .<br/>
          ..<br/>
          ...<br/>
          console.log(myLocalVar); // This will print out "This is my local variable!" string as it is accessing the variable from inside the function<br/>
        }<br/>
        <br/>
        function secondFunction() { // Here is another function accessing and manipulating the myGlobalVar variable<br/>
          console.log(myLocalVar); // When we try to access a variable that is local to a different function we will get an error as a result<br/>
        }
        </p>
        <h2> What happens if I assign a value to a varables that hasn't been declared? </h2>
        <p>
        In the case that you assign a value to a variable that has not been declared yet the variable will automatically become a <a>Global</a> variable. <br/>
        As you can see from the example <a>myVar</a> variable can be used from both inside and outside the function even though it hasn't been declared as a global variable, this is because it has automatically been done for us by the Javascript interpreter.
        </p>
        <h3>Example: </h3>
        <p>
        function myFunction() {<br/>
          myVar = "Hello, World!"<br/>
          <br/>
          //myVar can be used here<br/>
        }<br/>
          <br/>
        //myVar can also be used here<br/>
        </p>
        <h2> Errors Beware! </h2>
        <p>
        The scope of a variable can often be the cause of many problems when learning to code. If you run into a "Uncaught ReferenceError" then double check that all your variables that you are trying to access are global or have been initialized inside of the function.
