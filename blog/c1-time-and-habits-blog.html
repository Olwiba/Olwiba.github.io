				<h1>Time and Habits Management</h1>
				<h2> Which timebox and habits techniques did you try?</h2>
				<p>After going through the resources I found many different techniques and tips to improving productivity and maintaining my time efficiently, as this is an area that I find myself needing to constantly improve so I decided to try some of them out! The main techniques that I tried where: - The power of meditation - How mindfulness can improve productivity - Creating a habit - Flow - Timebox - Pomodoro technique As well as a few others... </p>
				<h2>What did you find interesting?</h2>
				<p>In the video How to create a habit I found it extremely interesting how he said that in order to jumpstart a habit sometimes it's best to use and extrinsic reward, then as time goes by you can then push the reward closer to an intrinsic one. The example that Charles and Ramit talked about was using chocolate as a reward when stating a habit, as this is stimulating the same parts of the brain as physical activity it releases endorphins making the user feel good. In the study they did they found the 3 months later that 89% of the users had moved away from chocolate and started using physical activity as a reward instead.  </p>
				<p>I was also intrigued by the meditation article, this is something that I have never properly looked into although after reading I can now see that there is so much more to it than just getting some quiet time. The benefits go on and on from better memory through to becoming more creative. </p>
				<h2> What worked for you?</h2>
				<p>Both a mixture of meditation and good time management using the Pomodoro technique I have found that my productivity has gone up tenfold while my stress levels have dramatically dropped. Using timeboxes set before the days beginning also helps me keep on track with what I am needed to get done. Keeping distractions from disrupting these time periods has proven to be difficult although with a bit of practice and dedication I feel that I will slowly be able to remove those distractions from the equation. </p>
				<h2> Which will you experiment further with?</h2>
				<p>The main thing that I really want to experiment further with is meditation, I have seen how it can effect mindfulness and productivity and now I really want to find out how to tweak my daily routine to help incorporate time periods for me to unwind every day. I am also interested in learning more about different types of meditation methods. I plan to start using timeboxes and the Pomodoro technique on a daily basis to help organise myself a little better and also help with keeping motivated. I have found that working in 25 minute slots doing work - play - work - play iterations keeps my interest levels high and means when in doing work in less distracted by what’s around me. I plan to experiment with what combination work best for me to get the most out of the time I have. </p>
